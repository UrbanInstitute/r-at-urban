##

Welcome to the Urban Institute R Users Group website. This website contains resources for using R at the Urban Institute for analysis, visualization, mapping, and more.

Please don't hesitate to contact Aaron Williams (awilliams@urban.org) or Kyle Ueyama (kueyama@urban.org) with any thoughts or questions about R at the Urban Institute. 

## R Users Group

*The Urban Institute R Users Group is committed to exposing researchers to the joy and power of R; developing beginner, intermediate, and advanced R skills; encouraging and supporting novel applications of R to public policy research; and building a diverse and mutually supportive community of R Users.*

## R Lunch Labs

The Urban Institute R Users Group hosts weekly lunch labs. R Lunch Labs are hands-on trainings for R users of all skill levels and soon-to-be R users. Each meeting begins with a 5-10 minute quick tip. Afterwards, attendees break into small groups and work on a range of topics including introduction to R, data management and plotting, mapping, and machine learning. Most users bring laptops, but there are a few extras for users without laptops. 

Please email Aaron Williams (awilliams@urban.org) to be added to the event invite list.
