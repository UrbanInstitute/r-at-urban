R Lunch Labs are hands-on trainings for R users of all skill levels and soon-to-be R users. Each meeting begins with a 5-10 minute quick tip. Afterwards, attendees break into small groups and work on a range of topics including introduction to R, data management and plotting, mapping, and machine learning. Most users bring laptops, but there are a few extras for users without laptops. \n\nWe have currently paused R Lunch Labs, but they will be back soon! If you have an idea for a topic you want to present informally at a lunch lab, please let us know!\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato\" />\n\n<div id=\"header\">\n<img src=\"graphics-guide/www/images/urban-institute-logo.png\" width=\"350\">\n</div>\n\n## R Users Group\n\nThis website contains resources for using R at the Urban Institute for analysis, visualization, mapping, and more.
