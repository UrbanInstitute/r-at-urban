## R Lunch Labs

The Urban Institute R Users Group hosts weekly lunch labs. R Lunch Labs are hands-on trainings for R users of all skill levels and soon-to-be R users. Each meeting begins with a 5-10 minute quick tip. Afterwards, attendees break into small groups and work on a range of topics including introduction to R, data management and plotting, mapping, and machine learning. Most users bring laptops, but there are a few extras for users without laptops. 

We have currently paused R Lunch Labs, but they will be back soon! If you have an idea for a topic you want to present informally at a lunch lab, please let us know!
